# Vex Robotics Team 7870A Drive / Auton Code
### Current Version: 1.0

Welcome to my team's robotics code! This is a generalized system mainly designed for my (moakdoge) projects, not for public use. I will attempt to document it, but it will suck. Do not use this, especially not in the current state.

## Features (As of October 23, 2025):
  - A custom drivetrain class with very experimental anti-drift system and supports any amount of motors
  - A controller system which can take in a drivetrain supporting two modes (Currently Tank Drive and Arcade Drive)
   - A macro keybinding system to allow you to keybind events such as intake/outtake systems to a list of buttons (like A, B, and Left Arrow at the same time)
   - An abstracted UI system for simple UI rendering
   - A file embedding system allowing you to embed and read files directly in the code

> This project is **NOT** designed to be used by others! I'm publishing this purely to release my code to my team easier. Maybe soon I'll properly document this project.
